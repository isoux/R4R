# üõ°Ô∏è R4R ‚Äî Rusted 4 Rings

> A hobby operating system experiment for educational and artistic purposes.

**R4R** is a hobby operating system project built from scratch with the goal of fully demonstrating the functionality and interplay of all four Intel x86 privilege levels ‚Äî Ring 0 to Ring 3 ‚Äî starting from the i386 architecture.

This is a personal and educational endeavor to explore legacy hardware features that are often overlooked or abstracted away in modern operating systems.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This is a hobbyist and educational project. It is not intended for production use. Expectations should be modest as development is done slowly, with care and curiosity.

## ‚ú® About This Project

> *"For a self-taught person like me, who is still learning to code, realizing an idea by writing from scratch is not an easy process at all. There is also a fear of failure and ridicule from genius people and professionals. But sincere desire and joy when you master the basic functionality of hardware ‚Äî even just a little ‚Äî overcomes all obstacles. It is an even greater inspiration that this little work will mean at least something to someone."*

This project was born from the curiosity and joy of exploring the **Intel x86 privilege ring model**, and particularly the lack of accessible examples demonstrating how all **four protection rings** interact in a real operating system environment.

Surprisingly, no public code example or documentation clearly showcases how **Ring 0 to Ring 3** can cooperate within a functioning kernel ‚Äî especially in the context of a minimalist, bare-metal OS.

> *‚ÄúWould it be possible to create a working OS kernel that utilizes **all four rings**, not for fun only, but to explore what functionality, structure, and security features Intel had envisioned?‚Äù*

This project aims to answer that question ‚Äî even if only partially ‚Äî and in doing so, encourages others to look back at the hardware roots of operating system design.

## Project Description

**R4R** is an *experimental hobbyist operating system* designed to showcase and demystify the functionality and interaction of all four Intel x86 protection rings (Ring 0‚Äì3), starting with the i386 architecture. It is not intended as a full-fledged operating system, but rather a platform for learning, demonstration, and artistic expression.

It stems from a curiosity to explore underutilized or forgotten hardware features. While most modern systems operate using only Ring 0 (kernel) and Ring 3 (user), **R4R** attempts to bring all four rings into play in a coordinated and observable way.

## Hardware Requirements

- Minimal support will begin with the **Intel 486 (i486)** processor.
- Will be **bootable from a floppy disk** for maximum compatibility with vintage PCs.
- Designed to run on real hardware (i386/i486) as well as emulators like **Bochs**, or **VirtualBox**.
- Note: **QEMU** is currently unsuitable for testing this build due to a known issue with legacy i486 protected-mode task switching.
See QEMU Bug 2024806 ‚Äì ‚ÄúProtected mode LJMP via TSS/LDT fails with pc=nil.‚Äù

## üìõ About the Project Name: R4R

The name **R4R** holds a layered meaning, carefully chosen to reflect both the spirit and the technical ambition of the project.

### üß∑ Primary Meaning: *Rusted 4 Rings*

- Refers to the four classic protection rings (Ring 0 through Ring 3) of the Intel x86 architecture ‚Äî ‚Äúrusted‚Äù as a metaphor for forgotten but still powerful features.
- The project is an homage to these rings, demonstrating their functionality and interaction on Intel processors, starting from the i386.
- Emphasizes a **hardware-oriented**, **non-portable** OS design ‚Äî one that embraces the features often hidden in portable systems.
- ‚ÄúRusted‚Äù evokes nostalgia for deep hardware-level programming ‚Äî a level often lost in modern abstraction.

### üåÄ Other Interpretations

- **Real 4 Rings** ‚Äî Emphasizes the rare goal of fully implementing and demonstrating the interaction of all four x86 rings.
- **Retro for Research** ‚Äî Highlights the project's educational and artistic goals. This is a hobby OS ‚Äî but with deep respect for retro computing and its research potential.
- **Rings for Rust** ‚Äî Reflects future plans to implement parts of the OS in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), especially where LLVM‚Äôs 32-bit support has presented challenges.

## üî≠ Technical Focus

- Written in **C** (using **GCC-14** with std=c23) with extensive use of **inline assembly**
- Based on the **Multiboot v1** boot specification
- Targeting **i386 (32-bit x86)** architecture
- Emulates or runs on real machines with **ring isolation** supported
- Uses a **custom GDT and TSS** to demonstrate privilege separation
- Demonstrates **Call Gates**, **Task Gates**, and transitions between all four rings

### ü™∂ Mili-kernel Design

A *mili-kernel* is the minimal kernel entity for each ring (0‚Äì3).  
Each mili-kernel owns its own scheduler, IRQ handling, and memory isolation within its domain.  
Initialization of every ring is performed from inside the ring itself (via IRET frames), while Ring 0 only provides global services through call gates.  

This ensures:
- clear privilege separation from the start  
- legitimate ownership of initialization inside each ring  
- modularity and traceability of system state

## üèóÔ∏è Future Plans

- README documentation for version 0.00
- Detailed documentation on GDT, LDT, TSS, and descriptor generation (there is already extensive documentation in the code)
- Releasing ISO and emulator-ready builds for easy testing
- Educational write-ups and videos to accompany the codebase

---

## üí° Inspiration

The project is deeply inspired by early UNIX systems that ran on Intel 386 processors, and in particular the work of:

- **William and Lynne Jolitz** ‚Äî creators of **386BSD**, one of the first open-source ports of UNIX to the i386 platform
- The simplicity, power, and elegance of **early i386 system architecture**
- The desire to educate and inspire others to **explore hardware-level programming** for its own sake

## üß† Why This Still Matters

> *‚ÄúIn the age of abstracted software layers, managed runtimes, and portable VMs, one could ask ‚Äî why bother with legacy features like 4 protection rings?‚Äù*

The answer is simple: **curiosity, art, education, and homage**.

We‚Äôre not here to reinvent the wheel ‚Äî we‚Äôre here to examine the spokes and admire the mechanics.
