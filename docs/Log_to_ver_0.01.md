# ðŸ§© R4R â€“ Log of Changes Toward Version 0.01  
### Initial fixes of non-functional code

After the system boots, when GRUB loads the required modules, the **init module** is placed at the **2 MB address**.  
Execution jumps there, where all core initialization steps are performed â€” this is where the `main()` function resides.  
From there, initialization continues through **IRET frames** into all four rings, setting up their respective environments.

What was non-functional in the previous iteration but correct in **version 0.00** has now been **refined and adjusted for version 0.01**.  
Previously, the **first 32 exception handlers** (CPU exceptions) were part of the **init domain**, which gets deleted after launching the main user task in **Ring 3**.  
As a result, those handlers were lost once the `init` module was unloaded.

To fix this, all **exception handlers** and their corresponding **IDT entries** were moved into the **Core mili-kernel**, so they remain persistent and under **Ring 0** control.  
This ensures that all critical faults and traps are now handled correctly within the Core domain â€” the legitimate owner of system exceptions.

âœ… **Summary:**  
Exception handling is now fully managed by the **Core mili-kernel**, ensuring stable and permanent interrupt behavior after the `init` module is unloaded.  
The initialization process remains clean, hardware-consistent, and logically aligned with the 4-ring architecture.

# Interrupt Handling Across Rings

In this setup, we handle hardware interrupts from Ring 3 tasks by routing them to Ring 1 handlers, ensuring controlled I/O access.

 1. IDT Descriptor
For the keyboard interrupt (`0x21`), we set an IDT entry with a **32-bit interrupt gate**.  
The gateâ€™s **DPL** is set to **1**, allowing Ring 3 to invoke it but ensuring the handler executes in **Ring 1**.

 2. TSS Setup
The **TSS** for the current task specifies a valid **Ring 1 stack (SS1:ESP1)**.  
When the interrupt occurs, the CPU automatically switches from the Ring 3 stack to the Ring 1 stack.

 3. IOPL and EFLAGS
The Ring 3 taskâ€™s **EFLAGS** have `IF=1` (interrupts enabled) and `IOPL=1`.  
With `IOPL < 3`, Ring 3 cannot perform `IN/OUT` instructions â€” ensuring all I/O must be executed at a higher privilege level.

 4. I/O Control
The **Ring 1 handler** can safely perform I/O operations since it executes at a higher privilege level than the Ring 3 task that triggered the interrupt.  
This guarantees that tasks in Ring 3 **cannot directly access hardware**.

 5. Segmentation and Gates
**Call gates** and segmentation ensure controlled transitions between privilege rings.  
Ring 3 can invoke the Ring 1 interrupt handler but **cannot escalate privileges** or perform unauthorized I/O.

---

 âœ… Summary
This architecture ensures that **Ring 3 tasks cannot directly interact with hardware**, maintaining system stability and security by enforcing privilege levels and controlled access to hardware through trusted Ring 1 interrupt handlers.
