# ðŸ§° Development and Toolchain Overview

The R4R operating system is developed from scratch using the **GCC compiler** with **inline assembly**, targeting **32-bit i386/i486 processors**. **Inline assembly** because R4R is strictly hardware-oriented and complex due to rings, so it is very important that the asm code be in c files and use everything from the domain of those files without unnecessary linking. This also provides better visibility, readability and understanding of the system ... The core intent is to maintain full control over hardware behavior, particularly across all four x86 protection rings. 

### Toolchain

- **Compiler:** GCC (std=c23) with support for Intel `__asm__` syntax
- **Assembler:** Inline assembly, no external `.S` or GAS-based files
- **Bootloaders:** GRUB v1 (`img` build) and GRUB v2 (`iso` build)
- **Emulators:** BOCHS (recommended with GUI debugger), QEMU (partially reliable)
- **Target hardware:** Real Intel i486+ CPUs (system is tested on physical machines)

### Design Principles

- Core components are written in **C** and **inline assembly**, where hardware-level control (like privilege transitions, task state manipulation, or descriptor configuration) is required.
- The system architecture emphasizes **tasks as hardware-managed objects**, with extensive use of **call gates** for controlled transitions across rings.
- Code is highly **non-portable** and intentionally focused on leveraging underused features of x86 CPUs, such as hardware task switching and segment-based protection.

### Build System

The build system for now supports floppy image GRUB v1 configuration.

Use the following make targets:

```sh
make clean   # recommended before each full build
make         # build folder build/ with objects and floppy-based build/sys_out/grub1.img
make bochs   # run floppy-based grub1.img in Bochs
```
### Emulator Notes

- **BOCHS** is recommended for debugging due to its excellent GUI debugger. Older BOCHS versions may be more compatible with Ubuntu 20.04.
- **QEMU** may exhibit inconsistent behavior â€” some features fail in emulation but succeed on real hardware. Development prioritizes **actual hardware** over emulator compatibility.

### Summary

R4R is a hardware-centric system. While most operating systems abstract away x86-specific features in the name of portability, this project attempts the opposite: to embrace x86 as deeply as possible, using GCC and modern GNU tools while maintaining a low-level, bare-metal mindset.
